# Shared-Bikes-Demand-Prediction

#### Problem Statement:

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits

Goal:


- To identify variables which are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

- How well those variables describe the bike demands
